/**
 * Rules:
 * The universe of the Game of Life is an infinite two-dimensional orthogonal grid of square cells,
 * each of which is in one of two possible states, alive or dead, or "populated" or "unpopulated".
 * Every cell interacts with its eight neighbours, which are the cells that are horizontally, vertically, or
 * diagonally adjacent. At each step in time, the following transitions occur:
 *
 *  --| Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbours dies, as if caused by underpopulation.
 *  --| Any live cell with two or three live neighbours lives on to the next generation.
 *  --| Any live cell with more than three live neighbours dies, as if by overpopulation.
 *  --| Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbours becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction.
